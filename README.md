# Moles
What we are going to implement is a tool for the medical doctors which can help them to analyze moles. First of all it is necessary to understand how to recognize a melanoma from a normal mole. The ABCD rule summerizes the research.
It consideres five features: 
•A: Asymmetrical shape. Melanomas are asymmetric moles 
•B: Borders. Melanomas are irregular 
•C: Color. Melanomas have multiple colors 
•D: Diameter. Melanomas have larger ones 
•E: Evolving. Melanomas change over time in size, shape and color
Our tool will analyze just symmetry and border getting two features, which will help the classification ofthe moles together with the other features that are not included in our task.The dataset is composed by 58 photos of moles: 13 low risk, 16 medium risk and 27 melanomas.
